# DQN-MountainCar-FinalProject
This is a report of my final project, implement Deep Q-Networks on playing Atari games for class COCS 5600 Fundamentals of Artificial Intelligence. Reinforcement Learning is a type of Machine Learning, and an area of Artificial Intelligence. It allows machines and software agents to learn its behavior based on the given prerequisite knowledge and feedbacks from the environment. The model used in this project is an artificial neural network, trained with a variant of Q-learning, whose input is a collection of information including game rules such as the available actions to be taken in this game and final reward achieved when accomplish the game and whose output is a value function estimating future rewards. I have trained several simple games offered by OpenAI gym by applying this model. The ultimate goal of this project is to deepen my understanding of the general idea of reinforcement learning as well as the theorem behind Deep Q-networks and, more importantly, to train my ability to solve a realistic problem by applying reinforcement learning.
